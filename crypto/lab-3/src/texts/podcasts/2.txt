Hi everyone.
My name is Patrick Akil,
and for today's episode,
I had Kyle Cook on from Web
Dev Simplified.
We go over his journey on how he started
more on the backend side
and moved his way to the frontend side
and now teaching full time
through YouTube.
We go over how to start
when you want to start in programing
as well as React
and the future of the ecosystem there.
I put
all his socials in the description below.
Check him out.
And with that being said,
enjoy the episode.
Beyond Coding.
Yeah 100%.
I mean,
like you said, it's like anything like
when I was learning how to program,
there's like the exact same thing.
It was just like
I would just always be building projects
and eventually
I just kind of learned how to program.
How did you.
Because, man,
I always had trouble figuring out
which projects to build,
but you had no problem
figuring out, like,
little smaller projects to work on.
I, i don't want to say I had no problem.
I actually had the problem
I had was the opposite of most people,
where I had like
a thousand ideas of projects
I wanted to build.
And I was like, okay,
I want to build this,
I want to build this,
I want to build this.
And I realized I was like,
okay, this is to advance
this is to advance this or to advance.
And usually without end up doing
is building something
I thought I could do,
realize it was too advanced
and I was just like,
Screw it, I'm just going to do it anyway.
And I would usually get it
like 80% of the way done
and then start something else.
Like, I never finished anything.
I got almost everything, you know,
80, 90% of the way there.
And then I would just jump
to something else
because it seemed
more interesting at the time.
Yeah. Yeah.
And was it I mean, I'm assuming it was
because you enjoyed it, right?
Not because you wanted
to get like a portfolio
and because of work.
I didn't even have an idea of a portfolio
like I was in school.
I was just like, I want to do this.
This is cool. This is cool.
I like this.
I'm like, Oh,
I'm interested in this topic.
I'm going to build a project
based on that topic.
And then when it came time
to make my portfolio, I was like,
I have a lot of projects
that percent complete. I got this.
Very good on portfolios.
I was like, Oh,
I have like a back and built
for this cool project,
but that's not going to do anything
on portfolio.
Yeah, that's,
that's really admirable
because I always was like, damn, I need,
I need a portfolio.
I don't know what projects to build on
and when I'm like, okay, a cool project,
let me write that down.
I never actually got to.
Yeah, I
mean, I have
a massive list of projects
I never got to even now, like I'm
doing YouTube stuff
and I'm like, Oh,
you know,
this would be a really cool project
like Build Out,
but I'm like,
What am I going to have time to do?
Like all these cool project ideas
on top of YouTube
videos and all the other stuff.
It's like,
I just don't have time for most of them.
Yeah, I get that
because I was wondering,
you actually started out
with like a computer science background.
Did I did I get that correct?
Yeah. Let's go to school.
So originally I applied to school
as a mechanical engineer
because I was into engineering,
math, science, that kind of stuff.
And then my senior year of high school,
I took an underwater robotics class,
which is like the weirdest thing ever.
I moved to Delaware my senior year
from like the Midwest,
so I moved to the coast
and had this underwater robotics class.
I was like, That sounds awesome.
I'm taking that.
And it was mostly mechanical engineering.
You know, we're like building this robot.
But there was a one week
section of the class
where we did programing
and we programed on this, like microchip
kind of thing.
The programing language
was literally called basic,
I think, but it was like
it wasn't like visual basic.
It was a different thing.
It was like basic,
but it was like a chip set language
and it was very basic.
I mean, it was super simple,
but I was super enthralled.
I was like, Wow,
this is the coolest thing ever.
I wrote like four lines of code
in this robot moved.
Like,
that's the coolest thing
in the entire world. Yeah.
So as soon as that happened,
I switched my major.
Before I even went to school,
I was like, I'm doing
computer engineering
instead of mechanical engineering.
Just on that engineering mindset,
I would have done computer science
if I knew,
but I went computer engineering
saw the business so cool.
And yeah, that's
pretty much what started me
on the programing path.
And then when I was in school,
you know,
I learned computer engineering,
which is a lot of hardware
and not as much software
as I would have liked.
You know,
I don't care at all
about the hardware side of things,
but I spent a ton of time
learning about it. Yeah, yeah.
Web development
was the thing
that really sparked
my interest in school,
so I just taught myself on the side.
I watched tons of YouTube
videos from like,
you know, Brad Traverse
and people like that
and just learned how to become a web
mostly from school because from online,
because there's only one class
in my entire school
that was web development based. Yeah.
And I couldn't take it until I think
my senior year of college.
And at that point
I'd already learned all this stuff
the class taught me.
So it was like the complete waste of time
because I was like, Oh, this is this.
I've been doing this for years now.
Yeah, that's really cool. I've never.
So most of the people I talked to
don't have a traditional
like software engineering background.
And even computer
engineering is more adjacent
to I would say
it's a software engineering background.
It's more closer to that
because as you
mentioned, having Web development
in kind of a third year.
But if you think about your
educational journey,
like there's a lot of it
come to practice in what you do now
or is it just
it was just education
and from then you moved on?
Yeah, I would say that what I learned
in school,
like the first year of my college
degree, was really useful
because I learned
like the fundamentals of programing,
like we learned C
and Java and like my first semester.
Yeah.
And it was really useful
and like teaching me
just basic programing language concepts
like for loops, conditional statements
like all the things
that every programing language has.
Like that was really useful
and kind of learning some of the back
and stuff of like
how memory works and stuff like that.
I mean, I don't really use much of that
because I write mostly in JavaScript
and you don't have to worry
about that kind of thing.
Yeah, but just knowing about
it was helpful.
But I would say every class
after like the first year,
if not even just the first semester
I felt was pretty much
I don't want to say useless,
but it wasn't that useful
because a lot of
it is like hardware based
or it's going to be,
you know,
like things
that I don't actually use in a day to day
is like a web developer
because I feel like
hard core computer science,
they focus a lot on like theory
and they focus a lot on like algorithms
and those kind of things
just don't come into play
nearly as much
when you're doing Y development,
especially frontend web development.
So most of what I learned was from
just using YouTube and blog articles
in the actual school degree
really only helped me with that
like initial jumpstart.
I feel it,
but the rest of it,
especially with what
I do on YouTube, like
I don't use any of it anymore.
Exactly.
I mean,
I love that
you taught yourself through YouTube
and through all the like
various free
means that are out there,
like blog posts, YouTube videos,
what else do we have?
I mean, podcasts are there as well
nowadays, a lot more.
Yeah, podcasts are a big thing now.
Like I didn't even know
about podcasting back
when I was learning.
It was mostly just like YouTube
and lots and lots of blog articles.
That's pretty much how I learned.
Mostly, exactly.
It's like there's something distinct
with this community
that we just take everything we know
and just put it out there
for free, for others to share
and to build upon right.
And through that,
you kind of hone
your skills as well
and get better at your craft,
which is really cool.
Yeah, yeah. Go ahead.
Oh, no, no, no.
I was just going to say
like a lot of people don't realize
how much you can learn for free.
I get asked all the time like,
Oh, what is the best course for X topic?
Or Is this course good?
Is this course good?
And I always say like, I don't know.
Like when I learned
I didn't buy a single course,
I just did it all for free online.
Like, sure,
I paid for school,
which helped with some of it,
but like I just learned it all online
for free.
Like you can learn
all that you need to online
as long as you have the time
that that's like
the biggest thing is you just need
a lot of time to sift through everything.
Yeah. Yeah.
Like, are you alone with that?
Like, there's a lot, especially nowadays.
Content is like
there's a lot of quantity.
You just have to find the quality and.
Yeah, definitely.
Got it coming out of university
then or college.
I don't know which one
or even the distinction in the U.S.,
but getting into your first job,
was it in
web dev as well or how did that go? Yeah.
So the thing that actually got me
into web development was
I kind of had to jump back to
when I was in school my sophomore year.
I went to the career fair
and I was looking for an internship
and I found an internship at a company
and it was
partially web
development, partially
like database related.
But we were doing like we were
I think we're coding in Visual Basic
actually is what we were working in.
So like not a super common language,
but it was working on web
development concepts.
So like there's HTML, CSS has JavaScript
and then visual basic
for like the backend stuff.
Yeah.
And I really enjoyed that
and that's
kind of what kickstarted me on the like
frontend development
web development space.
And like I learned a lot about CSC back
then, like I was super into CSS
and that kind of stuff,
not as much the other stuff,
but I was really into it.
So then when I was looking for jobs,
I was really looking for jobs
in that web development space.
So I applied to like four or five jobs
at the career fair when I went.
And I'm like, okay,
here are some local web
development companies
that I'd want to work at.
And the job I ended up
getting was actually
working at Ruby on Rails.
So they were in the web
development space.
But as a little more in back end focus
and front end focus, yeah.
And it was like an agency style company
and I ended up getting that job there
and I was, I really enjoyed it.
So like straight out of college,
I had a job in,
you know, like that back end ish.
We did some front end too,
but it was a pretty backend, heavy
like agency style job. Yeah.
Very nice.
I like
I mean the company I joined through,
I wouldn't call it an agency was more
a consultancies, the company I'm in now.
KBIA
But we had kind of an agency model in.
Customers would come to us
with kind of an idea
or even a concept
that they would like a product
of or a proof of concept of.
And we would help them
through the ideation
and the actual implementation
in which I got to do
a lot of kind of smaller
projects, even longer term.
But in a very short time period
where I got to touch
on a lot of different technologies
and all the different languages
and through that grow
kind of exponentially,
which is really cool.
Yeah, that's
something I really liked about
like the agency experience.
Like, it's definitely not for everyone.
Yeah,
because it's,
it's kind of a different experience,
but it's nice because you get to touch
on a lot of different projects.
Like I mostly worked on longer
term projects.
Like I would say
when I was there,
I probably did
like four different projects
in the time I was there.
So like almost one
project a year essentially.
Yeah, but it was just nice,
you know,
that jump between different things
because it wasn't always like,
okay, I was on one project for a year,
then another for a year.
Like I would
sometimes have
two different projects going or
so I kind of swap between them
where I'd have like one going for a while
and then it would take a break
because it was a seasonal based product
and I would do something else
and then come back that seasonal project.
So it was kind of
just nice to have variety
even though is in the same language
like we always did Ruby on Rails,
it was just nice
because even the same language,
you get a lot of differences
between different projects and different,
you know, products that you're building.
Yeah, it's interesting
that you mentioned Ruby on Rails
and kind of the role
was more oriented towards back end,
even though there were like
frontend components in there as well.
Because I sift through your YouTube
and what you do now is mainly
I mean more so frontend focus, right?
How was that transition.
So, so actually the main reason why I do
mostly frontend
and JavaScript
related content on my YouTube
channel is because of
when I was working in this company,
I was doing your mostly back and stuff,
but we had front end stuff.
Like I would work and react a little bit.
I would work in JavaScript
and just CSS
and those are the things
that I enjoyed most
when I was learning web development.
Yeah. So I was like, You know what?
I'm going to make this programing
YouTube channel.
I could make it YouTube channel and cover
Ruby on Rails, which I'm pretty good at.
Or I could,
you know, dove into JavaScript
and react and see assets,
which I'm like, not bad at,
but I'm not amazing at those things.
And I wanted to do those
because those
are the things that interested in me
the most.
And it was like, Well,
if I'm working on Ruby on Rails
8 hours a day at my job,
I don't really want to spend 4 hours
when I get home
making YouTube videos on
YouTube videos or something else
that's interesting to me.
So I was like, okay, I'm
going to do a lot of friends and stuff.
And my people would even ask me
to make Ruby on Rails content.
I'm like, I don't want to do that.
I do that all day at work.
I don't want to do it anymore.
Like it's fun,
but I can only do so much in one day.
So that's essentially
why I do
frontend development on my channel,
just kind of just grew from there.
That's really cool.
I, I love they said, no, no, no.
That's,
that's some work stuff right there.
He would do exactly what I love.
Yeah,
but isn't it kind of scary
because I mean, through that process,
you were
you were allowing yourself
to grow and learn
and kind of evaluate technologies
in there as well.
But you immediately
put it all on YouTube, right,
for others to consume
and to learn from as well.
But if you're not like asking for it,
I was assuming that
you were more confident,
maybe the Ruby on Rails stuff versus
the more frontend related stuff.
You didn't have a problem
like putting out
any of the frontend stuff initially.
Yeah.
So my front end knowledge
like when I worked at my previous company
as an intern, we did jQuery exclusively.
I'm
slightly embarrassed to admit
I didn't even know there's a difference
between jQuery and JavaScript
because I was throwing in straight
to jQuery.
Like that
was the first thing I learned before
I learned any JavaScript.
So I thought they were just
kind of the same thing.
I thought like one was built
on top of the other,
like they were the same thing.
I didn't realize until years later
that they were different things.
Yeah, so it was a little bit
intimidating for me to jump into,
you know,
building these JavaScript videos
because I had a jQuery foundation,
but I didn't have
solid JavaScript foundation,
so I kind of had to learn a lot
of those JavaScript skills,
even though there's a lot of relation
between jQuery and JavaScript,
just building things out
using pure JavaScript
was kind of a challenge for me at first,
and it was nice
being able to do these videos
because I would kind of
have to learn these topics.
I would figure them all out
and then I could make a video on it.
And if you can make a video
where you teach someone something,
even if you just like write
a blog article,
any time you teach someone something,
you have to understand
it really well
because as you're teaching it to someone,
they're going to have questions.
Or if you're like
making a prerecorded video
or blog article,
you're going to think like,
okay, they're probably going to ask
why this thing happens
or why this works this way.
And you need to know why
that works that way
in order to explain it.
So you really need to learn something
at like a fundamental level,
because I could do
super basic JavaScript stuff before,
but I couldn't
tell you
why everything worked the way it did
until I started making videos on it.
And I had to ask myself, okay,
why does this work this way?
People are going to ask that.
I need to know why this works that way.
Yeah,
I mean, that makes a lot of sense, right?
You feel responsible
in teaching in that way as well.
So when questions come,
you don't just want to be like,
well, I don't know.
And then that's the end of it.
You still want to be able to help them
with the questions that they have then.
But just the.
And I think. Sorry, go ahead.
No, I just can say,
I think
one of the most important concepts
with teaching is not necessarily
waiting for people to ask you questions,
but thinking of the questions
they're going to ask ahead of time.
Because if you want to be
an effective teacher,
you need to know
the five most common questions
someone's going to ask you.
So when you're writing your content
and making your content,
you can already answer those questions
before they even have
a chance to answer or
ask them to, you know,
and that really,
I think, helps
elevate whatever you're teaching
and it helps elevate
you because you have to learn
those things yourself.
Yeah, that's a
that's a great point, actually.
I mean, it doesn't matter
what you're teaching
or even what you're presenting,
if you can figure out what the audience
is going to ask, anticipate
and already answer that
throughout your explanation, man,
you're giving a great explanation.
Then. Yeah, yeah.
That's why I think that people
that are new to something,
not like completely fresh,
but people that are newer to
something are better at explaining it
than experts.
Because an expert doesn't
remember what the questions they asked
when they were learning where. Yeah.
So they explain it
in a way that they're like, Oh, well,
of course
you already know what that means.
I've known that for 20 years, you know,
but most people don't
know what that means right away.
So if you just learned something
a week ago,
you're probably better at explaining it
to someone that's known it for months.
Yeah. Yeah, exactly right.
If it's if it's been something
you've been doing year in, year out,
I mean, it's kind of fitting
in your routine, right?
Things that might be obvious to
you might not be obvious to someone
that's new or fresh
or it just the starter in that way.
So you kind of obfuscate
that in the way you communicate
or the way you explain things,
and then things don't make
quite as much sense for you as it
does to someone else.
Yeah, one thing when I was learning
and I found a lot of like,
you know,
YouTube channels and blog articles,
they would use a lot of really big words.
And I could understand
some of these big words
cause I had that
computer engineering background.
So they pounded big, complicated words
into my mind for four years.
But like a lot of people
that are learning this on their own,
they don't have a dictionary definition
for all the crazy complex,
you know, like,
you know, words like memorization.
Like what?
That just sounds like memorization
and spelled wrong,
you know,
like people don't know what that means,
that you have to be able
to explain things in ways
that are easy to understand
for everyone,
not just people that have, you know, that
strong background of jargon.
Yeah, yeah. I completely align with that.
I want to touch on what you said
earlier in
jQuery, JavaScript
and even Java when I started out.
I mean, I had some programing
courses in university,
but the one course that
I had was web development
and it was teach yourself
how to make this website.
You can pick from these designs
and that sort of stuff.
So I looked online and everything
kind of looks the same and I was like,
What is this different?
Is Java different
from JavaScript than even jQuery?
What is that like?
Teaching yourself
how to do
those things
is really just diving down the rabbit
hole, trying out things
and figuring out yourself
what the differences are.
And when you when you use a what
and what was actually the distinction
there?
I'd love to know if you were to go back
or even if you were to start now
with regards to teaching yourself,
I mean, front end or back at
you can pick a language,
but how would you start
teaching yourself how to code
if you were to start right now?
I mean,
obviously I would
just buy all of my own course,
all my videos.
Look at that small plug.
No, seriously,
what I would
I would do is I would try to experiment
with lots of different like sectors,
because first
I would do my research to figure out
what are the fields in
whatever case you care about.
Like let's say you're interested
in learning how to program,
but you don't know what you want to do.
Like maybe you want to do web
development, game
development, desktop development
you don't really know.
So I would research
what the different fields out there are,
try to figure out them,
just like watch some explainer videos.
There's a lot of them out there
and then think, okay,
what are the things
that most interest me?
Like, Oh,
this one kind of sounds interesting
or this one sounds interesting.
Then I would dove a little deeper.
Okay, figure out what that topic's
all about.
Like, okay,
I'm interested in web development
or game development.
Learn a little bit
more about what those entail.
Like, okay, web development,
you're going to be using JavaScript
at some point in your web development
journey or accessing game development,
maybe unity
like is the most popular game engine.
So you kind of get these ideas
of what these tools are
and then just go ahead
and start
learning the very basics of them
and try to just build something,
see if you enjoy it.
Like don't go super
deep into it,
just like super basic Gainesville,
my project build like Pong for example,
or build,
you know, like a
to do this application
something really basic
and see
is this something that even enjoy
because you may get a year
into learning about development
only to realize you know
what game development
sounded more interesting to me.
I should I wish I knew that a year ago.
So if you just kind of experiment
spend,
you know, a month or two months
experimenting with like three
or four different topics
that really interest you
throughout what you actually like doing.
And maybe you realize, okay,
I like web development.
Now, you figure out,
do you want front end or back end?
And again,
do that experimentation phase
and it may take longer
to get to the point
of being proficient as a developer.
Yeah,
but you're going to know
that you're in a field
that you really enjoy
because you may spend a year
going to web development
only to realize
you really don't like it that much.
And that's
a really terrible feeling
to think you wasted a year of your life
and something
you really don't even enjoy.
Yeah, I get that. I like that.
You start it with the domains, right?
Whether it's game development
or web development
or like even embedded stuff, stuff
like that, Iot things,
it starts with that, right?
Because you can jump into a technology
and then figure out
what you can do with that.
But then you're very much
technology focused
and then
the switch to a different technology
is going to seem very daunting, right?
Because you finally mastered
or learned this,
this technology became outdated.
So starting with the domain
and figuring out from there,
okay,
what do I then
need to learn from a technical level
to be proficient within this domain,
right, to get the stuff done.
But if I'm looking at myself
and even my journey,
it can be quite daunting, right?
Let's say
I want to start in the game industry
or even vet what development?
If I'm starting with a web page
and I have to build in like a log in form
or even a To-Do app,
it can seem like quite a lot
when you're starting out
this kind of big thing
and everything is kind of interrelated
and everything is kind of
has to make sense together.
How do you make things small enough
for you
to actually be able to start
and make progress in there as well?
Yeah, so this is a great question.
Probably one of the biggest problems
I find that people run into,
you know,
I teach a lot of people
and a lot of them come to me,
they're like,
I don't know how to get started.
Like I can follow
along with every tutorial out there,
but as soon as I build the project
my own, it's just a blank text editor.
I just stare at it
and I have no idea where to get started.
Yeah.
So I think the biggest thing is
once you learn that the super basic
is programing like,
you know, variables, conditionals
like loops, like the basic building
blocks of programing.
You are comfortable,
you can start building projects,
but you don't know where to get started.
I recommend always starting
with a really small project.
If you think it's doable,
make it 50% smaller
because then it's actually probably
going to be within your skill set.
You always overestimate what you can do,
but then on top of that,
take this project like let's say
it is a to do list application
and break it down
into every single component.
So I think
if you're a user of this web application,
what are the things that you can do?
So on a to do list application,
you can add it to do,
you can check market
to do to say it's complete,
you can delete it to do,
you can edit it to do.
So you have like these different ways
that a user can interact
with your web page
and then think, okay,
I want to build out
all these different interactions.
What do I need?
So for someone to enter to do,
I'm going to need to have an input box
on my page.
So already you have an input element
you can add to your HTML page.
You probably need a button
so that they could submit
that and create it.
And you're going to need some way
to listen to when they create that.
So you're going to need some type of form
event listener to listen
for when they create that to do item.
So you kind of have like a checklist
of different things
you need to do in your mind.
And instead of immediately
jumping in and starting to write code,
I recommend
writing out in like English pseudocode
even what you think you need to do.
So write out all these steps in English
and then from there
it's really easy to plug
in the actual different code elements
because you have in your mind,
you're like, okay, I know what ifs,
so I know what event listeners are.
I know these different things.
So you can just read your English
and you can say, Okay,
I need a way to enter data
boom input element.
I need a way to listen for
when they submit that data.
Okay, I have an event listener for that.
So you have all these different things
that you can kind of connect
to those English words,
which are much easier than saying,
okay, I want to create
a to do list application.
Like that's super overwhelming,
but I need to add an input
element to my page. Anyone can do that.
Yeah, I really like that because
I mean, I think back to my own journey
in when I started out,
I would jump right in, right?
Just write, write code, see what works,
what doesn't work,
trying to figure out
how to make this thing happen on the fly.
And I mean, I started
especially my job here actually
looking at my colleagues
and how they approach things
because they would have kind of a feature
that I would be like,
How the hell do you do this?
Or I have no clue.
Like even starting out
and they would write things on paper
or they would kind of high over
explain to me, okay,
these things need to happen.
And it wasn't even code.
And I was like, okay,
that that does make sense, right?
Because if all of those things
come together,
then we do have
this kind of added feature in that way.
But that wasn't
that had nothing to do with coding
in and of its own.
Right.
That's just kind of structuring
your thoughts in a way
that makes sense
chronologically and even being able
to explain
that to someone else,
for them to understand
and then also to think it makes sense
or even to kind of
go back on things and discuss things
and then we implement
because then the implementation is way
more smooth.
We have kind of a checklist of things
we want to go through.
We do all of that
and then it comes together. You have it.
And that's my
that was a shift in thinking,
at least for me.
Yeah. Yeah, I 100% agree.
Like I think that learning to program
is like two parts.
There's the actual code like learning,
you know, ifs and for loops
and those kind of things.
And then there's actually learning
how to think
like a developer,
how to break down a big problem
into a much smaller problem.
That I think is the skill
that a lot of people skip over.
They're like, okay,
I want to learn how to code.
I'm going to learn the coding part.
But they skip over all of the actual
thinking part
and that's the part where they get stuck.
They're like, Okay,
how do I build this project now?
Because you never actually learned
how to think like a developer
and how to break these big problems down.
And if you can break them down
like you mentioned,
it makes the implementation
an absolute breeze
because all you're doing
is just taking all this knowledge
and your brain
and just barking it out onto a page
following essentially
a list of instructions.
Yeah, I like
I like that
you distinguish
in, in thinking like a developer.
But for me
what was really hard
is when it actually clicked,
when I saw the differences
in thinking steps
was always when I collaborated
with someone else, right?
Someone that was a bit
more senior than me
and was educating me
and guiding me
through that journey in there as well.
I think when you're starting out
on your own,
you very much focus on
how do I get this done
before you try and figure
out your own thoughts,
or even most often
you don't even get a
feedback on on your approach
and how you did things
rather than what you actually did.
Mm hmm. Yeah.
No.
If you can find someone
that is
even just a week
ahead of you in, like,
learning to program,
I think that's a really important skill.
I know
it's not always possible to find someone,
but if you can find someone
that really helps
with accelerating your learning process,
you can kind of,
you know, jump ideas often
be like, hey, does this make sense?
Does this make sense?
But even if you can't find that
the idea of rubber ducky,
which is essentially
where you just talk to a rubber duck
or to like a stuffed teddy bear
or to the wall or to yourself
and just explain the problem
you're having.
A lot of times
just the idea of verbally
explaining what you're trying to do.
You can already see what the issue is
that you're running into.
Like if you don't know
how to implement something,
explain what
the different steps of the problem are.
And a lot of times that'll, you know,
light enlighten
you on what the actual problem
you're running into.
So I recommend doing that
a lot for people
that are stuck on something.
Just write it down or speak to it
with someone or just know nothing.
Speak to yourself.
And a lot of times
that'll actually fix the problem for you.
Yeah, yeah.
It's an interesting thing
in a lot of the things
are in your head, right?
And they can be very unstructured.
So for you to be able to communicate
that to
either someone else or in your case,
a rubber duck or yourself,
it doesn't even matter.
The act of structuring
your inner thoughts
and being able
to externalize them, right,
writing them down
or communicating them verbally,
it helps with your thinking process
and all of a sudden
it will click
and you will figure out
kind of what the next step
where the missing pieces there.
No. Yeah.
When I
when I worked at my my last company,
it was a small company.
So it was just
me and my boss were the only two
that worked in the office where I worked.
And there be many times
where he'd be like,
Hey, Kyle,
can you come over here for a second?
So I'd walk over
and he'd be like,
I got a question
on, you know, X, Y and Z technology.
I'm like, I've never used this.
I don't know anything about this.
He's like, I don't care.
You're just a rubber duck right now.
I just need to, like, talk to someone
and have, like, just some feedback.
I just need to talk this out.
And, like, it's easier
when there's someone
there is like, okay, that's cool.
I can do that.
I can listen and not know anything.
And half the time he'd be talking to me,
and all of a sudden, like mid-sentence
he'd be like, Okay, I got it.
And that would be it, you know?
So it's just kind of funny
to think that, you know,
you can talk to someone
who literally knows nothing
about what you're trying to do
and that may solve the problem for you.
Yeah, yeah.
There's a funny word in it, Dutch,
which I haven't really found
the right translation.
It's called spotter,
and it's similar to sparring in a
in kind of a boxing ring.
But you do that
when you just need
to kind of mirror information
to someone
either rubber ducking or for them
to actually also give you feedback
in that way
for you to structure your thoughts.
Right.
And it doesn't have to be related
to programing.
It can be something that happened
in real life
that you just want to spar about.
I still don't know the right translation,
but we use that very often.
Nice. Yeah, for sure.
I lost my train of thought, actually,
because we started out
kind of Ruby on Rails
and you went to YouTube
and you wanted to teach yourself
or even educate others
with regards to Frontier Technologies.
But when did you actually decide
to do YouTube full time?
Like, did it just take off?
And you were like,
Oh yeah, this is my thing.
We're going to do this full time.
Yeah, when that that's. A good question.
So it's kind of two parts.
It almost happened at the very start
and at the very end it kind of took off.
So when I started the YouTube channel,
I in 100% intentionally
it was like, okay,
I want to make this a business
that eventually I can do
as a full time job.
So in order to come up
with my channel name, actually,
this is kind of a funny story.
I was like,
I want to have a dot
com domain name associated
with my channel name.
So instead of just creating a YouTube
channel name, having or whatever it was,
I went to like,
you know, some domain website.
I was just typing in different things
that sounded interesting.
I was like, web dev, dev, easy, web
dev, this web dev, whatever,
you know, development, whatever what?
Because I knew I wanted to be world
development based.
And finally, I've landed on Web
Dev Simplified.
I was like, okay,
that domain is not taken.
It doesn't cost me $1,000,000.
Like every other domain.
Every other. One. Yeah.
So I was like, okay, that's
what I'm going to do.
So that's the entire reason
my channel is called Web
Dev Simplified because I was like,
It makes sense
because my goal was to kind of like
make things simple
and easy to understand.
So like I was already
kind of on that
like terminology,
but as soon as I found
that domain name wasn't taking it,
it only cost like $10.
I was like, Okay, bye.
That's exactly what I want. Got it.
And my channel, literally
same day after I bought it.
And just the act
of buying the domain name.
I mean, it was literally like $10,
but the act of putting down money,
it made me more serious about the project
cause I probably would have
at some point quit.
But having that $10 I put down,
I was okay.
I'm actually dedicated to doing this,
and that really helped push me
through like the beginning stages,
because the beginning is so hard
because you don't know anything.
It takes forever to build a video.
You release a video
and one person watches it
and they downvote it
until you suck it,
take it, super demoralize or skinning.
Yeah.
So that putting that $10 down
really helped
because I'm like,
okay, I've put some skin in the game
even though it's only $10,
like my blizzard brain was like,
I've put something into this,
I need to contribute to it. Yeah.
And then from there, it started to slowly
grow, you know, and after about a year,
I think I was at
about 10,000 subscribers.
So it was pretty good growth for a year.
And I had a little bit of,
you know, spikes around that time.
And then the big thing
was when COVID hit, a lot of people,
you know, they were at home,
they had more time at home.
They had either lost their job
or they're worried
about losing their job.
So a lot of people came to YouTube
for entertainment,
but also a lot of people came to YouTube
to learn a new skill,
a skill
that could be used for a remote job.
And probably the easiest and best skill
to learn for that is,
you know, web development of some form.
So I saw a huge growth
in my channel around that time.
You know, that
April, March time period
I think was around 2020
when all that started
and it started to continue to grow.
And I was already at a point
where I was thinking about
quitting my job
because I was like, okay,
I can kind of see this starting to
it doesn't overtake my income,
but I can see eventually,
maybe a year or two from now,
this would overtake
my full time income on my job.
So I was like already on the fence
and thinking about quitting
and then COVID came in.
Might, you know,
YouTube channel started
skyrocketing even more than before.
So I told my boss I was like, Hey,
how would you feel about me
going part time?
Think I want to go part
time for a few months,
see if this continues to go
in, then maybe I'll quit.
Is that.
Yeah, that's fine. We'll support you.
Like they were very supportive, so.
Yeah, that's 100% cool. Yeah.
So I went part
time and I was able to even keep
like my health benefits
and stuff so super useful.
But I was only working
like 20 hours a week
so I could dedicate
a lot of time on YouTube.
And within just one month
of being part time,
I realized I was like, okay,
this is way better.
I need to do this full time.
So I told my bosses like,
Hey, I know I told you
I'd be here for a few months,
part time, but like,
I think I need to be done
at the end of this month.
Like,
I don't want to miss this opportunity.
So I was like, I'm quitting.
And I think it was July 2020 when I quit.
So it was the very end of June.
So I started July.
So almost exactly two years
after I started my channel,
I quit, went full time and yeah,
I wasn't making my full time income.
I wasn't making the same amount
I was at my full time job,
but I saw the potential.
Like I was like, okay,
I think this can, you know,
even overtake my full time job.
So I need to jump on this now
before the opportunity passes me.
That's awesome, man.
That's really cool.
I love the
the little start, the little investment.
That was also a huge investment
in your mind.
You're like,
I already invested like
we have to make this through.
A We have to actually start, right?
Because I think starting in most cases
is the biggest obstacle you have.
Once you get the ball rolling
and once you kind of found your routine,
find your rhythm, that is good, right?
Then you're like, okay,
we have these kind of things,
X amount of things.
I already have thoughts aligned.
I know how to make the video,
I know how to structure it.
I actually have consistent C
in the days that I upload,
so then you have a rhythm.
But the hardest thing
I think still
starting and actually doing the yeah.
Yeah.
I think another thing that really helps
this is for any skill of, you know,
starting a YouTube
channel, starting anything,
even just learning to code
is have some people that depend on you.
One thing that really helped me was
I was part of a Discord Channel
for game development
actually at the time,
but there's a few people on there
that were interested in learning WebGL.
I mean, they'd ask me questions
because they knew I was, you know,
skilled in that department.
So I started making videos
and I was like, Hey,
why don't you guys
check out these videos?
There's like five people or whatever.
So I'd be able to get like
five views on these videos.
And, you know,
these people were like, Oh, you know,
it's really helped.
I really like that.
I'm looking forward to the next one
and just having that commitment
where these people
were like
actually looking for it,
even it was only a couple of people
looking forward to a new video.
It really helped
motivate me cause I was like,
Man, it's been like two weeks
since my last video.
These people are really hoping
for a new video.
Like,
I really need to get in there
and just grind through.
Like,
I remember one of the first videos
I did, it was maybe like, I don't know.
And within the first ten videos
I did is the first video I ever did
that did well.
I was just
it was a get tutorial
and I was just grinding
through this video.
I think it was like
one or two in the morning
when I finished the video
because the editing process took so long
and I just posted that video,
I went to bed.
The nice thing
was that my job had flexible hours,
so I was like, I am sleeping in tomorrow.
I don't normally stay up that late.
And I went to bed
and the next morning I woke up
and I looked at my phone
to see how the video did.
It had 9000 views
and I was like,
my previous
best video was like eight views.
So I was like,
What the heck they're saying?
So that really helped
motivate me to like,
I got a decent number of subscribers,
like maybe 100 subscribers off of it,
but they never came back
and watching the video essentially.
But like
just that little bit of motivation,
like the fact
that I was motivated
to help these individual people
let me to grind,
you know, into two
and to make this video.
And that video ended up doing
really well,
which help motivate me further.
So just it's kind
like a snowball effect at that point.
Yeah. Yeah.
I mean, I've heard this as well
can Kenji said that he came on my podcast
and he says
like, motivation is pretty fickle
and it depends on the person.
But once you feel responsible
also for others and others expect
something of you.
That can be one of the biggest motivators
you can find, right?
Because you feel accountable,
you feel responsible,
not just for yourself, because,
I mean, letting yourself down is way
easier than letting others down.
So eventually you're delivering,
you find your way and that and that.
Yeah, I think that always stuck with me.
Yeah. Well, really cool, man.
I, I wonder
if you've seen this as well,
because when I started
on web development,
I mean, that was when
like at a university
and we did a lot of BHP,
not so much evangelists
but among yourselves as well.
Then I did mostly back and stuff
actually almost exclusively
a little bit of you
because that was the framework we used.
But then I came into a role
and it was almost completely react
and I didn't actually start off
understanding JavaScript
until after
I did
most of the React components and React
functionality and stuff like that.
Because React was just a bit easier
to understand
that I didn't really have to figure out
what happens under the hood,
and I did enjoy it
because it was component structure.
A lot of things made sense
kind of conceptually in my head.
I could understand
how things fit together
and you have some functionality here
and there.
So I never actually bothered
with the vanilla Java script
until just recently
where I have a project
which is a lot of static HTML templates
go as a back in English HTML
and then just vanilla
JavaScript over there when we need it.
But I think a lot of people
start out with a framework,
whether it's Vue,
whether it's even Angular
or mostly React is what I've seen.
I think they
start out with that
because I think
I don't know, might be easier.
What's your take on that?
Yeah, I think a lot of people start with
something like React
because they see that jobs out
there are all looking for acts
that like, okay, if I want a job,
I need to learn, react. Yeah.
And then they also see that
like all these YouTube videos
coming out around
React, everybody's talking about React,
everybody's doing React projects
like it just seems like
React is the way to go.
And I think even
some people don't even realize
like how much it's built on JavaScript,
so they just kind of jump into React
or maybe they'll learn a little bit
of JavaScript or like, okay,
I learned the basics.
Now I'm jumping into React
because I want to be able to do cool
real world things because,
you know, playing
JavaScript is just the thing of the past,
you know, it's like kind of like
the Jay Corey of today is like, Oh Jay.
Cause the thing in the past
people think JavaScript,
that thing in the past
because React is replacing it.
But I think it's really important
that you understand
the core of JavaScript.
Like I tell everyone
that's trying to learn, react
or take my react course.
I was like,
I have a list of JavaScript concepts.
I was like,
You need to learn all of these concepts
before you even bother with React
because it's going to make your life
so much easier.
You know, it's not a hard list.
I mean, it'll probably take you a month,
two months to learn through
all of these different concepts.
But then when you go to learn,
react, react is going to be a breeze
because a lot of people
that get tripped up and react
get tripped up on JavaScript concepts,
not react
concepts are like,
Oh, what is this import export stuff?
Or Why is it when you pass, you know,
an arrow function to a component,
you know,
like on click event, like they kind of
aren't really sure
how passing functions work.
So they get confused
by that kind of thing,
like passing by reference versus value
versus calling the function versus
just passing the name of the function.
Those kinds of things trip up
a lot of people
that don't learn the fundamentals
of JavaScript first.
So I'm just like,
learn these fundamentals.
It's going to take you a month or two.
It's probably
not going to be the most fun thing
in the world
because fundamentals always suck.
Yeah,
but when you go to learn, react,
instead of taking four months
to learn React,
it'll take you one month to learn React
because you're going to know
all the JavaScript stuff.
All you need to
learn is react stuff
and react is pretty small, you know,
comparatively to JavaScript.
Yeah, exactly.
I also had to backtrack
because I was like this.
This doesn't make sense.
And then when I actually figured out
how to do it,
I was like,
None of this stuff is react based.
Like, these are more fundamental
things that I just didn't know
and I learned on the fly.
You can do that as well.
But when you start out
with a foundational base,
it makes adding on top of that
I think a lot easier.
Have it really? That wasn't my journey.
Yeah.
No, I've
always found that
learning something on the fly, it's fun
because you get to start
building stuff immediately.
Yeah,
but I find and it may seem really fast
at first because I'm like,
Oh man, I got this to do list already.
Like, this is crazy.
If I spent two months
learning JavaScript,
I would not have this by now.
Yeah,
but then
as you go, as the time compounds
that you still keep skipping
these fundamentals,
you start to realize
that, okay,
things are starting to take me longer
than everyone around me.
Like, why is that?
I feel like I have
a good understanding of this.
We are lacking those fundamentals.
It's kind of the same thing
about learning an instrument
that we talked about earlier.
It's like
if you're trying to learn an instrument
to be able to play music,
you can skip the fundamentals
and go straight
into playing songs
into you're going to start
to learn songs quicker
than if you started
with the fundamentals.
You're going to struggle
with certain things
because you don't
have those fundamental skills in place.
So if you learn those fundamentals first
and then start going to learning
songs,
you'll be the one of those songs faster.
I think it's the exact same thing
with, you know, learning
concepts versus learning
how to build projects.
Yeah, yeah.
That's a great example.
It's very similar to that.
And even that was kind of relatable
to my own experience
where I was like, Okay,
I get a lot of things done right?
And that is so satisfying
getting the thing done
that you need done,
except when you're a bit slower
than other people
and other people are like, Why?
Why is this guy taking so slow?
Or What's wrong here? Or even internally?
I'm like, okay,
this should be simple, yet
I can't figure out this small thing.
And sure,
I can google it
here and there,
but at some point I'm like, I've Google
this so many times
that I should actually like figure out
how this works
before continuing,
because this is something foundational,
this is something recurring,
and this is something
that's lacking in my current skill set.
So then you figure it out and you.
Are, I think the. Sorry, continue.
Go ahead.
I was gonna say I think the
thing that a lot of people run into
is like,
it's fine to do this kind of stuff
where you learn on the fly
and you're
just like experimenting with things.
But after you're done with the experiment
and go back and think,
What did I struggle with?
What did I not really understand?
Like you may be able to the code,
you copied it from StackOverflow
and it worked.
But why did it work?
Try to ask yourself why.
And if you can't answer, go back
and try to learn that thing.
And it may take a little longer at first,
but by doing that, it'll make your future
projects better
so you can kind of
get the best of both worlds.
So you can start
with building something complex.
And when you run into an issue
where you don't understand
why something works,
just look it up after the fact
or look it up later.
And that's going to really help
build your concept based skills
as well as you'll be able
to build projects.
Yeah, I love that.
I'd love to touch on stuff
that's a bit more,
I don't know,
like more advanced,
maybe in React specifically
because when you got the basics
down, what what do people
struggle with next?
Is it more like
getting your components
to render
as efficiently as possible
or state management
or even kind of lazy loading your stuff?
What do you think
are more advanced topics that
people kind of struggle with?
Yeah, I think some of
the more advanced concepts
people struggle
with is just the conceptual
model of React.
So React is very declarative while,
you know,
learning normal
JavaScript is not at all declarative.
So kind of switching your mindset
from this imperative
mindset to a declarative mindset
where you realize like,
okay, when I change state, it's
going to render my component
and I don't have access to that new state
until after my component renders.
And like how the use effect hook
is going to work
within all of these
different state updates
and like how the component
lifecycle works.
These things
I think are confusing for a lot of people
because when you learn normal JavaScript,
those are not concepts you learn.
You don't care about declarative stuff.
Everything's imperative.
Like you have an event listening.
When you click on it, it
fires this function
and then you change the variables
and then you have to
manually update everything
while with React, you change your state
and then everything reruns again
all the way from the top,
which is 100% different
than how normal JavaScript works.
So I think we were rewiring your brain
in that way is what
a lot of people struggle with,
because I find
when I get asked questions
a lot,
it's like updating the state variable
and I tried to use it after that
and it didn't update.
It's like,
well, you had to wait for your component
to re render
or they look at their use effectively
like why is my use effect not working?
Oh, you forgot this dependency.
Because you know, when this thing change,
you need to make sure
you account for that.
So I think these are not quite
like super advanced concepts.
It's more like that intermediate level,
like you understand react,
but you don't understand
why everything's working.
I think those are the biggest problems
people run into.
Yeah, now you get that GitHub as well.
I've seen a lot of stuff.
I mean, a lot of stuff is evolving
very fast,
especially in the JavaScript ecosystem,
but also in the React ecosystem.
I've played around with Gatsby
and I've even done some next year
stuff as well.
What's your take on the frameworks
that are popping up
and that are kind of using
elements of react
to kind of enhance their
own structure in there as well?
I think they're great honestly.
Like my blog article,
I used to have it written using Gatsby.
I ended up switching over to Astro
eventually because I had some problems
with Gatsby
that just wasn't working right.
I don't know if there's a me problem
or Gatsby problem.
I just was like, I'm such an actor.
I don't really care figuring this out.
I spent too long trying to figure it out,
but like things like next gen. Yes.
And there's even frameworks
like Redwood and Bullets.
I think those are reactive based as well,
or maybe their own ambiguous
application of things.
But like I really like this
because it takes away
some of the hard stuff of react
like server side
rendering and page routing.
Those kind of things just
aren't fun to do
and they're very difficult
to do sometimes.
So having this framework next chance
to just take care of all that for you
I think is really useful.
And they're not so prescriptive
like a Ruby on Rails
where it's like, you must do it this way.
They're very ended like reactors,
but they just give you a few extra
guide rails
that make those decisions
and those, you know, boilerplate
code things
a little bit easier to work with.
Yeah, yeah, I agree.
I really enjoyed Gatsby when it worked.
And then I think,
I mean, we used images
that were a bit too
too big
and then we had a plug
in that kind of reformatted
all the images
and then all of a sudden
their build took way too long.
And on that list I built
didn't take it anymore.
And yet then it wasn't fun anymore.
But when it works, it is great.
And I mean, I love using it.
Additionally with either a verse
or a net the fly.
So even deploying your thing
and giving it to users in the end
makes it so much easier.
And I love that
we're getting more and more tools
that make things simpler.
I just wonder where it goes.
Is it
eventually going to be one framework
or are we always going to have choices
and kind of opinionated frameworks?
And you get to pick and choose from there
and is it going to be
I mean, we have react, we have you
angular element
I don't know svelte is also
they're kind of popping up here
and there does it
there's one every day,
I'm sure, at least.
So I just don't know where it's going.
I love to have your take on that as well.
I personally feel like
it'll kind of end up like the
the view react
frontend framework space
where there's going to be maybe one
that's probably more popular
than the rest.
Like right now,
I would say next year is kind of that one
where it's like
it kind of
does everything well enough and it's
probably the most popular one out there.
And then I think there's
going to be other options
that are a little bit
more specialized, like Astro or Gatsby.
They're more specialized
in what they do
like they're more focused on building out
like statically rendered pages,
like they could do other things.
But I'd say that's really rare.
They're specialized in. Yeah.
And then on top of that,
there's going to be even further things.
So like
next year is kind of like
built on top of React
and then there's going to be things
like Blitz and Redwood
that are going to be built on next year
or like the next version of next year,
the things that really take it
to the next step.
Or it's like,
okay,
we thought of all the things for you,
we're going to give you
an opinionated way to do things.
I think that's actually the way
that JavaScript is going to go,
because a lot of people are fed up
with having to make
all the decisions themselves,
like why does not have routing decision?
Why does it not have this built in?
Like,
why do I need to include
all these libraries?
I think people are getting to the point
where they're like, okay,
I just want to use next chapter.
I just want to use this.
And it's
going to just do all of this for me
and I can write my code
and not worry about thinking about
which one of the 74 different libraries
am I going to use.
Yeah. Yeah, I like that.
I, I mean, it's part of where, why
I am a fan of go
because it's a language
and all of the
things are in that language
that I usually would use.
I really have to think of
when I introduce a dependency
because a lot of things
are already implemented through that.
I can make APIs, I can make my services,
I can hook my front end to it,
and I can even do a lot of static
HTML templating.
I now have a stack
where it's exactly like that,
a lot of back end static HTML templates,
a little bit of vanilla
JavaScript in there
and bull Myers's CSS framework.
And it runs like a train
like it does exactly what it needs to
and it's super performant
and everything
kind of comes out of the box.
But JavaScript in and of its own
wasn't quite like that.
React took it one step further
and still on top of that we're building
and now we have next year
and still on top of that we're building.
So I like,
I like the thought of
just getting the technology
that as a tool
and having enough tools
in that toolbox
or the technology that as a toolbox
and having enough tools in that toolbox
to do whatever you need to
with regards to web development or
pick a toolbox that is kind of apt,
whatever you need to do,
whether it's building an e-commerce
or even building some other thing,
I like having a toolbox
that's kind of varies various enough
and I don't have to
keep trying
to figure out which tool fits in here
and which one it's maintained still,
which one can I use
and which one is not going to
like break my shins on the long run?
Yeah.
No, I honestly think that the future
is going to be like a Ruby on Rails
style JavaScript framework.
I just think something like
that is going to happen.
Like we're already starting to see that
with like Bullets and Redwood.
They're kind of like pushing themselves
towards that territory.
And I think if
something like that becomes
good enough
that it's usable
by people like, you know, becomes
1.0, and it's got a lot of features
I think that could be the next big thing
that really like takes over next.
It doesn't maybe
take it over, but it's like,
you know, another option besides next
it's like, hey, do you have,
you know,
just a basic write application
like everybody else is building
use this framework
because it's going to make it so easy.
That was my favorite thing
about Ruby on Rails.
It's like if you're building
just a basic CRUD
application, which is 90% applications,
like it's so easy and so quick.
And I think if we get something like that
for the front end as well
with JavaScript and React, it's
going to be a game changer.
Yeah, yeah, I agree.
I'd love to know
your take on full stack
development
as well as kind of a final touch
because you've done
both back end as well as Frontend.
And for me
coming out
from a kind of a same journey as you,
I go into the front end
and it was more
as like a sink or swim I guess
because I actually
needed to deliver stuff
and teach myself on the fly as well.
But in there
I was like many people
that are really have a good understanding
of both concepts,
write a lot of things back out related
and a lot of the things frontend related.
Those are rare.
Usually I find people
that can make stuff
happen on the frontend
or can make stuff happen on the backend
and that
are really apt on the other side.
But what I see on the market
is a lot of people
also ask for that full stack
roll or even full
stack with DevOps experience
or even taking a step further
and knowing a lot
about cloud and security
and even test development
and everything like that.
Like it's a whole package.
And I get that if JavaScript and react
and the frameworks
that we use are simpler
and things are a bit more established
than opinionated,
then you don't really have
as much choices anymore.
So it kind of becomes more tangible
and things are still within your grasp
when you want to be effective.
But as it is now,
I think it's
it's a big ask sometimes to allow people
or to ask from people
to be apt in a lot of technologies.
And I feel like sometimes
we even
keep asking more on top of that, right?
Because you also companies
also ask for years of experience
both in the front end,
both in the back end
for technologies
that are, for example, years old.
And they ask for ten years of experience
in that technology.
It's a bit ridiculous
sometimes how that comes across
because as a full stack developer
still like a realistic thing.
Your take,
what are your thoughts on that? Yeah.
So I would say
if you asked me this question
like five or ten years ago, I'd say,
yeah, it's it's a reasonable thing to ask
because your project
is going to have a focus
in one way or the other.
Most projects are either going
to be more complex
in the front end
or more complex in the back end
unless you get to like the scale
of like Facebook, where it's
complex everywhere.
But at that point
you don't have full stack
engineers,
you have hundreds of each part,
you know, you have hundreds of front
and hundreds of back end developers.
You don't have to worry about front end
or full stack engineers,
but most of the projects aren't
massive projects.
I feel like five, ten years ago
it was 100% possible
because you could be specialized
in one area
and you can have enough knowledge
in the other area to get the thing done.
And I think now the front end
has gotten a lot more complex
than it used to be.
It used to just be JavaScript, HTML, CSS,
now you have react, now
you got next year,
which pushes
you even into the back end a little bit.
You have you felt
you have all these different frameworks
and they keep getting more
and more complex
and it gets harder and harder
for someone
to be specialized,
like in the back end
with enough front end knowledge
to get things done.
As these more complex frameworks
come out, it's definitely possible,
but I think
if you're a company,
you'd be better off
hiring a dedicated back
end and a dedicated
frontend developer
than hiring
one full stack developer
to try to take both those roles
because they're going to be better
at one versus the other
and they're just going to lack
in that one department.
You can't be an expert in both
because it takes so long
to learn all the skills needed.
And even if you become an expert
in back end
and an expert in front end
five years from now,
whichever one you do more
you're going to become an expert in,
and then things in the other department
are going to change,
especially if you can back on Frontend.
It's going to be way different
in five years than it is now.
So like you're
no longer to be
an expert in that area
because you spent more time
on one specialty than another.
I think it's important for people
to have an understanding
of both backend and front end
if possible.
It makes you more valuable developer
because you can understand
if you're a frontend developer
what the struggles of the back end are
and like what isn't is not possible.
Yeah, you don't need to be an expert.
You don't need to be the person doing
both the front and the back end.
Yeah, yeah, I agree.
I like being able to both to a point
where I can be effective. Right.
And if I if our frontend guy
that's really specialized
and knows a lot
about the frontend ecosystem is gone,
we can still continue as a team, right,
because we fill those gaps in that way.
But if it comes to making
our front end application
very performance
or the bundle size a lot smaller
with a lot of tree
shaking and different package
management things in there as well,
I would love some of that
specialized than that
because that right now is not really
what I'm what I'm comfortable in.
But that's also where a team comes
in, right
where you have those specialties
and they come together
and you can make decisions as a team
because in the end,
I think you're also responsible
and accountable as a team
for that, for the end result, right?
So if you can align on your specialties
in that way
or kind of fill those gaps, rather,
I think you can be very effective in a.
Yeah, I agree.
Like when I worked at the agency,
some of the projects I worked on
were smaller projects,
so I may be
the only developer on that project.
So I had to fill both the back end
and the front end role
and even sometimes the DevOps role,
which I would always try my best
to push off on someone
because I hate that section of, Hey,
come on, I'm so bad at it.
Like TerraForm
Config Files
are the worst thing I've ever seen
in my entire life.
Like, I was like, Oh,
I almost want to quit now.
Just terrifying.
But like,
I feel like
if you're on a small team like that
and you're working on a smaller project
where it's small enough
you can be one developer,
it's probably fine
if you do both the back end
and the front end.
It's not going to be perfect
in either section,
but it's going to be good enough.
And if you're the only developer,
it probably doesn't matter as much
because the project
is probably going to be small enough.
It's okay
if it's not 100% performant on the back
end or 100% performant on the front end.
But once you start to scale up
beyond that kind of level,
I think it's really important that you go
and you become
proficient in just one of those sectors,
which is why
if you learn only frontend development,
you can still find a job.
Even if places are asking
for a full stack developer,
I think they're trying to find something
that doesn't exist
and they'll kind of realize if they hire
someone as a full stack developer
that they're actually just,
you know, a front end developer
with some backend
knowledge or back in developer,
some frontend knowledge and not a full,
full stack developer.
Yeah, yeah. Like that.
I mean the key thing there is
you can get it
working on a smaller scale,
but once you want to scale to
I mean just throw a number out
there, hundreds of thousands of users,
millions of users,
multitudes of millions of users.
Then it becomes a lot more preferable
that you have people that are specialized
in optimizing things, right?
Whether it's front end or back
end or more of the DevOps
side of things as well,
your platform and your infrastructure,
it makes more sense
because those smaller optimization
wins, those smaller efficiencies
will have huge effects
on your actual applications
or your actual user experience
in that way as well.
And that is in the end,
what you want to optimize.
So optimizing your technology
through that
will optimize your user experience.
And that's
I mean, that's what we're doing it
for, right?
For the people that love using whatever
we're building.
100%.
Like I think people
focus too much on performance
when the scale is small
and not enough when the scale is large,
like when you're only serving 100 people,
you don't need to have
Facebook levels of performance.
It doesn't matter
if it takes them a little bit of time
to access your website
because it's so small, it's
probably not going to make a big impact
when you have a million people
access your website
every day, like every millisecond,
that performance
is going to make a huge difference
on like your server costs
and your server load
and the experience for the user.
Like even if you can shave
ten milliseconds off a million request,
that's a huge amount of server
cost that you're saving
because you don't have to make those
10 million
or it is 100 million milliseconds.
That's a lot of time.
I don't want to do the math,
but that's a lot of money.
You could be saving.
And also your users
are going to see that difference.
Yeah, yeah, I completely align with that.
I really enjoyed this conversation.
Kyle, is there anything
you still want to share in there?
I'm I would say if
you're just starting out
learning, don't focus and worry
too much about,
you know, the technologies
and things like that.
Learn, you know,
the concepts like programing,
concepts, how to think like a programmer.
Those are the skills
that you can transfer anywhere.
Like it doesn't matter
if you learn, react,
JavaScript, angular back
end stuff, game development.
If you understand
how to think like a developer
and you understand
the different programing concepts,
those are transferable
between every language in
between any different specialty.
So learning
those skills is the most important,
I think,
and most people flip it
where they think
that those are less important
than learning how to actually code.
Yeah, yeah.
I completely agree with that as well.
Cool.
Thanks, everyone.
We're going to rounded off here

Check him out,
let him know you came from our show.
And with that being said,
thanks for listening.
We'll see you on the next one.
